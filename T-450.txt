A watermark is a logo that stands for watermark and \
        prevents copying when placed on an image or image. Sometimes \
        it can be used not as a logo, but as a special text. When \
        using Watermark, you can block the copy or see the original \
        author even if there is a copy. Sometimes the site logo and \
        sometimes different names are placed on the image or in a \
        blocking corner to create this purpose. The picture above is \
        an example of a watermark.
