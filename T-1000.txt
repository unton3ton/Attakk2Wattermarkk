A watermark is a logo that stands for watermark and \
        prevents copying when placed on an image or image. Sometimes \
        it can be used not as a logo, but as a special text. When \
        using Watermark, you can block the copy or see the original \
        author even if there is a copy. Sometimes the site logo and \
        sometimes different names are placed on the image or in a \
        blocking corner to create this purpose. The picture above is \
        an example of a watermark. He embedded the logo (watermark) \
        into the picture, making it less obvious. Thus, stealing the \
        logo has become more difficult. Watermark is a feature that is \
        generally valid for transactions on the internet. Therefore, if \
        you want to watermark any image you want to protect, you can \
        easily do this from your computer. Watermark can be created \
        very easily with any photo editing program. One of these programs\
         is the 'Watermark' application that we have implemented. \
         The term Digital Watermark was coined in 1992 by Andrew \
         Tirkel and Charles Osborne. Watermarks are identification \
         marks produced during the papermaking process.
